# SleepingData
# Sleeping Data Analysis Project


The **Sleeping Data Analysis Project** involves analyzing a dataset containing information about various animal
 species, with a particular focus on their body weight, brain weight, sleep behavior, and exposure to environmental dangers. 
 This dataset includes factors such as **predation risk** and **sleep exposure**, which are critical to understanding the sleep patterns and survival mechanisms of animals.


## **Goal**

The main goal of this project is to conduct an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and derive insights that help understand how different factors influence sleep patterns in animals. Specifically, the project has the following goals:

1. **Explore Relationships**: Identify and analyze the correlation between **body weight**, **brain weight**, **sleep exposure**, **danger index**, and **sleep duration**.
2. **Data Visualization**: Create meaningful visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) to visually represent the relationship between the key factors.
3. **Insight Generation**: Generate actionable insights based on the patterns observed in the data. This could help in understanding how animals adapt their behavior based on biological and environmental influences.
4. **Report Findings**: Document and report the findings through an analysis summary and visualization results.

## **Scope**

The scope of this project includes the following:

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Working with the dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Using tools like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to generate graphs that clearly show relationships between the variables.
- **Insight Report**: Summarizing key insights and findings in a structured report, which may include visualizations to back up conclusions.
  
### **Out of Scope:**

- **Advanced Modeling**: This project does not include building predictive models (e.g., machine learning models).
- **Data Collection**: The dataset is assumed to be pre-collected. No new data will be gathered for this project.
- **Real-time Analysis**: This project is based on static data and does not involve real-time data collection or analysis.

##  **Brief Description of the Dataset**

The dataset contains the following key columns:

- **body_weight**: Body weight of the animal (in kilograms).
- **brain_weight**: Brain weight of the animal (in grams).
- **max_life_span**: Maximum life span of the species (in years).
- **gestation_time**: Duration of gestation (in days).
- **predation_index**: A scale indicating the risk of predation (1 = low risk, 5 = high risk).
- **sleep_exposure_index**: A measure of how exposed the animal is to danger during sleep (1 = low, 5 = high).
- **danger_index**: Overall measure of the environmental danger (1 = low, 5 = high).
- **total_sleep**: Total hours the animal sleeps per day.

This dataset will be analyzed to understand how **predation risk** and **danger exposure** affect **sleep duration**, and how **biological factors** like **body weight** influence sleep behavior.
